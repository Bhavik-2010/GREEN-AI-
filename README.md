# **Green AI: Afforestation Monitoring using Drone Imagery**  

## **Overview**  
Green AI leverages machine learning and image processing to monitor afforestation efforts by analyzing drone-captured imagery. The goal is to identify sapling survival rates post-plantation using ortho-images and geospatial data.  

## **Problem Statement**  
The Odisha Forest Department plants millions of trees annually, requiring an efficient, AI-driven approach to track survival. Our solution processes drone imagery to detect sapling casualties.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Image Processing  
- Geospatial Analysis  

## **Libraries Used**  
- Computer Vision(OpenCV)
- Matplotlib 
- NumPy 
- GDAL 
- gdown 

## **How it Works**  
The model compares drone images pre- and post-plantation to detect missing saplings.
